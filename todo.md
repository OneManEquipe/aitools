            - [x] restructure modules
        - [x] refactor AbstruseIndex to make it more abstract
            - [x] make a DummyAbstruseIndex subclass and use that wherever needed
            - [x] make other subclasses for all other "implementations"
            - [x] remove container classes from the AbstruseIndex and pass them from the superclass constructors
